# Pseudo

**Current Version: 0.2**

A small project that compiles Pseudocode into other languages.

See the <a href="https://github.com/ninjaprawn/Pseudo/issues/3">plans</a> for what's being worked on and coming up!

Compiler inspired by https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler

Syntax based off http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html. Improvements and additions to be made.
