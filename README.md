# Pseudo
The high-level programming language. 

It's not really a language as it is a compiler to other languages. 

See the Plans for what's being working on and coming up!

Compiler inspired by https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler

Syntax based off http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html. Improvements and additions to be made.
